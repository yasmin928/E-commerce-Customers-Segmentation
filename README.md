# E-commerce-Customers-Segmentation

This project successfully implemented an unsupervised machine learning model to segment customers based on their transactional behavior and demographic features. By analyzing the resulting customer segments, we were able to identify distinct groups with varying coupon usage patterns and redemption rates.

Key Findings:

Segment 1: High coupon usage, moderate redemption rate, predominantly younger customers.
Segment 2: Low coupon usage, low redemption rate, older customer demographic.
Segment 3: Moderate coupon usage, high redemption rate, diverse demographic.
Recommendations:

Segment 1: Offer targeted coupons with limited-time offers to maintain engagement and encourage repeat purchases.
Segment 2: Consider personalized recommendations and loyalty programs to increase coupon usage and redemption.
Segment 3: Provide exclusive discounts and early access to new products to reward their loyalty.
By implementing these targeted strategies, the business can improve customer satisfaction, increase loyalty, and drive sales. Further analysis and experimentation with different clustering algorithms and feature engineering techniques could provide additional insights and refine the segmentation model.
